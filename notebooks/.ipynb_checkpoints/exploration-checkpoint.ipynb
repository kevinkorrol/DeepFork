    "To feed models data, the features need to be in a numeric form. Fortunately, in chess the PGN-format (portable game notation) is often used, and this also is the case in our dataset. PGN makes it easy to get all states and moves from a game using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)'>algebraic notation</a>. To extract features from the data, we need to somehow parse the PGN-format. For parsing, move generation, rule checks and other useful features, we will use the <a href='https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html'>python-chess</a> library.\n",
